# self-balancing-robot

## 📌 Overview
This project will give you a overview of implementation of a self balacing robot with the code, schematics and the components used in the project.

## 🎯 Steps

1. Start with basic motor and sensor control.
2. Make a frame for the self balancing robot.
3. Integrate both motor, motor driver, and imu to get real time data.
4. Install a PID control in the robot to make it fully functional.
